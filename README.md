# deepleraning.ai-course
This is some records of Andrews' `deeplearning.ai` course from `Coursera`. I have uploaded my programming implement to this warehouse. There might be something wrong with my work, be free to email `zpzhang1995@gmail.com`.

### About install tensorflow-gpu on windows
- Cause I found many people get many issues while installing tensorflow-gpu on windows, and there are many talks before tensorflow-1.4.0 shows like this on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42011070/on-windows-running-import-tensorflow-generates-no-module-named-pywrap-tenso).   
- You will not face problem above again thanks to tensorflow-1.4.0!  
-  **python3.6.x + cudnn6.0 + CUDA8.0 + tensorflow-1.4.0** work perfect!
- Remember move files in cundnn to CUDA8.0 accordingly (you also do this in the past)!

### Learn Tensorflow and Deep Neural Network
- I recommend you a video course for learning tensorflow from Google, you can download [here](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1ge2xPuF)
- A good introduction about Deep Neural Network, download [here](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1c1FviBA) <br/>
- Best results on standard dataset like MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, ILSVRC2012... [here](http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/)<br/>
- Keras Documentation Chinese Version, download [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dGsZPRj)<br/>
- Deep Learning by Goodfellow, download[here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1sm0dvBn)
### Some Good Machine Learning Tutorial
- Expectation Maximization(EM) course by Xu Yida on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq5s80ZCmC0&list=PLyAft-JyjIYpno8IfZZS0mnxD5TYZ6BIc)<br/>
